First, it doesn't supported imprt os in windows for tts.
we have to use pyttsx3, whih have features such as speech speed, 
volume, 2 different voices (male and female), but not different langueges.

i then tried it with gtts and pygame which offers different languages 
but it do not have features such as speech speed, 
volume, different voices.

i then tried to deploy it using flask,
The RuntimeError: run loop already started error occurs because 
pyttsx3 tries to run its event loop while the Flask server is 
also running an event loop. This can be resolved by running the 
text-to-speech engine asynchronously using a separate thread or 
process.

The RuntimeError: run loop already started persists because pyttsx3
uses an event loop that conflicts with the threading model of 
Flask. To resolve this, you can use multiprocessing instead of 
threading, which allows the text-to-speech engine to run in a 
separate process and avoids event loop conflicts.
nothing is working other than speak and that too, very late after
 pressing the button
